Personal roadmap to learn and experiment with designing machine learning systems.

## Learning Path: Designing Machine Learning Systems
(2025-05-01)
This repository tracks my personal journey to learn and experiment with the design of modern machine learning systems. It's a hands-on exploration of tools, techniques, and best practices—documenting both progress and lessons learned along the way.

## Learning Goals

1. Learn version control (Git & GitHub)
2. Learn object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python (if necessary)
3. Learn how to build ETL pipelines
4. Learn machine learning model development
5. Learn PyTorch and scikit-learn for building and training models
6. Learn SQL for data querying and analysis

Note: I may also dive deeper into web scraping as needed.

## Reflections & Insights

(2025-06-14)  
Recent investigations into staying current with the fast-moving ML landscape revealed an incredible stack of technologies that can boost our skills. Thanks to resources like The Batch and Answer.AI, I’ve discovered exciting areas to explore:

- GenAI Building Blocks  
- AI development with code assistants  
- Modern web apps built in pure Python

As I progress through model development, I’m also preparing for the next phase: deployment. When the time comes to shift focus, here’s the learning path I plan to follow for deploying machine learning systems:

1. Learn how to expose a model using FastAPI  
2. Package the model and environment using Docker  
3. Deploy locally or on cloud platforms  
4. Add logging and monitoring to track performance and behavior  
5. Explore CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment  
6. Learn about model versioning and retraining workflows
