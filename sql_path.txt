- postrgreSQL is the technology of choice because is free, open-source, offers standard and many modern features for object relational database system
- the bibliography for learn the concepts and the use of this tech gonna be the documentation file available in the official website of the project
- (2025-05-03) i obtained the pdf book for PostgreSQL 16 Administration CookBook
- (2025-05-26) we start the reading on the book of PostgreSQL 16 Administration CookBook for discover that we do not have the basic knowladge for understand this jargon
- (2025-05-26) we find out that the documentation that we download fro postgreSQL was interesting and more user friendly, in the explanations at least but then convert technician jargon for install. The book for administration cited previously help us to install through the EDB installer (this is an enterprise that maintain PostgreSQL). The instalation was not difficult just follow the steps
- (2025-05-27) after the installation is completed we learn about the pgAdmin4 GUI where we can work with the server of PostgreSQL and the databases. Then for connect and interact with postgres we see a youtube content of nueralnine (interesting channel always have what i looking for) and we start a chat with openAI chatbot
- (2025-05-27) with the content of the video and the guide of the chatbot we see that for interact with this ORDBMS (ObjectRelationalDataBaseManagementSystem) we need a python library like sqlite3, the needed is call psycopg. We create a new project directory in desktop/ for this learning path with poetry and add this lib. This actions create the directory and the virtual environment for this project.
- (2025-05-27) Then we create a main.py file for the first interaction inside this file we define the code needed to interact, for that reason we need to remember to select the interpreter of our environment for this project, for that we access to the executable path with 'poetry env info' command. Then we initialize the connection with our postgre server, for that the postgre service may be running. Like sqlite3 we need a conn for the connection and a cursor for execute the actions in the db. The connector need some parameters that we can find in the pgAdmin4 GUI, right click over the server and go to properties. Then we pass some execute actions to the cursor with the .execute() method of psycopg and for make the actions valids we need to commit, for saver resources it is always necessary to close the connection and the cursor. Look the main.py file for more review on the learnings today. For see the changes always refresh the pgAdmin4 GUI. Continue the reading for webScraping and search in the documentation for python executions
